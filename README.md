Hacking with Swift Project 2 - with solution to the challenges

This project is based on Paul Hudson (Twitter @twostraws) Hacking with Swift Project 2. 
It contains **my** solutions to his challenges during Day 21 of the 100 Days of Swift initiative (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/21).

Please let me know if you find something really broken or if you would have faced these challenges in another way.
